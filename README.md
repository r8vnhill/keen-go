# KEEN-GO: Generalized Optimization Framework

**KEEN-GO** aims to be a flexible and extensible optimization framework for solving a wide range of optimization problems, including combinatorial, numerical, and multi-objective domains.

> ⚠️ **Project status:** Early-stage / pre-alpha  
> KEEN-II is currently under active development. At this stage, the repository primarily contains project configuration and build setup. No user-facing features are implemented yet.

## ✨ Goals (planned)
- Support for modular optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, differential evolution)
- Extensible components for selection, mutation, and evaluation
- Integration with analysis and visualization tools
- Multi-language support starting with Kotlin

## 🚧 Current State
- ✅ Kotlin + Gradle project setup
- ✅ GitHub Actions for CI
- ❌ No functional optimization features implemented yet

## 🛠️ Getting Started

You can clone and build the project to explore the current structure:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/r8vnhill/keen-go.git
cd keen-go
./gradlew build
```
